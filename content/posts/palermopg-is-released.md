Today I launch my second open-source project: [PalermoPG](https://github.com/ruslanlesko/palermopg). It is a server for the picture gallery. PalermoPG is also a back-end which powers [AirPicHub](https://airpichub.leskor.com). 

With PalermoPG you will be able to create a self-hosted picture gallery using your custom front-end solution (web or mobile). API is documented in the readme file on GitHub.

PalermoPG is powered by Java and uses Vert.x as a web and asynchronous library. The database supported is MongoDB.

If you are interested in my other projects, please check out [BrightonUM](https://github.com/ruslanlesko/brightonum), open-source authentication, and user management system.
