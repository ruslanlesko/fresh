Today I have launched the first version of AirPicHub! It is available at [airpichub.leskor.com](https://airpichub.leskor.com).

It took me about a year to develop it.

AirPicHub allows you to upload your photos to the cloud, group it by albums, share with others, and access it from any device. No need to worry about managing your gallery.

Now I can finally try using it on my own and test it in real life. I hope my relatives and friends will also find it useful. Apart from usage in daily life, I feel like this development experience made me a better software engineer.
