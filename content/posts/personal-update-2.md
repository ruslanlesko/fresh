After four months of serving in the Ukrainian Army Forces, I am returning back to a developer's life. I did my best there, and now I am able to focus on software development. Hopefully, I will be posting articles more often now.

However, the war is still going on. We should not forget about it and keep helping Ukraine to win. Please donate to our trusted funds like [Come Back Alive](https://savelife.in.ua/en/), [Charity foundation of Serhiy Prytula](https://prytulafoundation.org/en) or [United 24](https://u24.gov.ua).

Assuming the fact that I spent several months in the army, my pet project [Digestwave](https://github.com/ruslanlesko/digestwave/) is going to be delayed by some time period. So now I am targeting the beginning of 2023.

Stand with Ukraine!
