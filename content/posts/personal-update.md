I haven’t done any updates regarding myself for a while. As you know, there's a war in Ukraine. Due to martial law, I was mobilized into the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And I am already serving my country for more than a month. 

The thing is that even if you don't have any military experience, you don't have any other choice in the current situation. The alternative would be a jail in case you refuse.

Currently, I am more or less safe since I am not on the front line. But do not expect a lot of activity from me since I have very little spare time during this period. However, I manage to take a few minutes for coding to keep my brain working. 

I miss normal life a lot: my lovely wife, work, and traveling. I hope I will be able to get back to all of this soon. In a worst-case scenario (excluding death), I’ll be stuck here for a year. 

I wish Ukraine will win soon. 

If you are willing to help, you can support our front-line soldiers by donating to the following proven organization: [comebackalive.in.ua](https://www.comebackalive.in.ua)

Members of this organization help to buy necessary equipment (helmets, drones, night vision devices, etc.) to maximize the survivability of our heroes who defend Ukraine.

Stand with Ukraine!
